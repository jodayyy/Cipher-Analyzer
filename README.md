- tkinter (comes with Python on most installations)

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jodayyy/Frequency-Analysis-Tool
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Frequency-Analysis-Tool
   ```
3. (Optional) Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
